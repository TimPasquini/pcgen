STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SKILL|TYPE=Charisma|TYPE=Dexterity|TYPE=Intelligence|TYPE=Strength|TYPE=Wisdom	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	BENEFIT:You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving the chosen skill.

Apolcalyptic Spell 				TYPE:Metamagic			MULT:NO		DESC:Your spell becomes infused with the devastating horror personified by the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, temporarily transforming reality into a treacherous ruin.																																																																												ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																		SOURCEPAGE:25		BENEFIT:You can alter a spell with an area of effect and a duration of instantaneous to become an apocalyptic spell. When you cast the spell, the area affected by the spell’s instantaneous effect becomes ruined and devastated in appearance. All surfaces in the area are treated as difficult terrain, and Climb, Fly, and Swim checks attempted in the area take a penalty equal to the spell’s original spell level. The difficult terrain and skill penalties last for a number of rounds equal to the spell’s original spell level. An apocalyptic spell gains the evil descriptor. An apocalyptic spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell’s normal spell level. Spells with the good descriptor can’t be apocalyptic spells.
Archon Diversion					TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:You throw yourself in front of blows meant for allies, giving those allies a chance to strike back against the enemy once they have attacked you.											PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Archon Style,Combat Expertise,Combat Reflexes															PREMULT:1,[PREATT:4],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=3]																																																						SOURCEPAGE:25		BENEFIT:The penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC against a single opponent decreases to –1. Once per round while using Archon Style, when you have at least one hand free or when wielding a shield, you can divert one melee weapon attack targeting an adjacent ally to yourself. After resolving the attack, the ally you protected can make an attack of opportunity against the diverted opponent. You expend no action to divert the attack, but you must be aware of it and must not be flat-footed. You must choose to divert the attack after the opponent has declared the melee attack, but before the attack roll is rolled.
Archon Justice					TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:Attacking you during your period of vigilance opens foes up to allies’ strikes.																						PREABILITY:4,CATEGORY=FEAT,Archon Diversion,Archon Style,Combat Expertise,Combat Reflexes											PREMULT:1,[PREATT:8],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=7]																																																								SOURCEPAGE:25		BENEFIT:You no longer take a penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC, and you can activate this effect as a swift action or a move action. Whenever you take damage from an attack you diverted to yourself using Archon Diversion, each ally threatening the attacking creature can make an attack of opportunity against that creature.
Archon Style					TYPE:Combat.Style			MULT:NO		DESC:You protect your allies from harm, even at the cost of your own safety.																								PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise,Combat Reflexes																			PREMULT:1,[PREATT:2],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=1]																																																					SOURCEPAGE:25		BENEFIT:While using this style, as a move action, you can protect adjacent allies from a single opponent that you currently threaten. This grants adjacent allies a +2 dodge bonus to AC against that opponent’s next melee attack [as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn], but causes you to take a –2 penalty to AC against that opponent until your next turn. The dodge bonus against the designated opponent’s attacks persists even if your allies move away from you.
Authoritative Spell				TYPE:Metamagic			MULT:NO		DESC:Your magic holds all the intricacies of Axis’s idealized laws, enforcing their strictures upon your enemies																																																																																					ADDSPELLLEVEL:2																		SOURCEPAGE:25		BENEFIT:You can alter any spell that targets a single creature to become an authoritative spell. When you cast an authoritative spell, choose one of the following activities to prohibit: move closer to you, move away from you, make a melee weapon attack, make a ranged weapon attack, cast an offensive spell, or cast a nonoffensive spell. A creature that is affected by the spell and fails its saving throw against that spell [if the spell allows a saving throw to resist] cannot perform any action of the selected type on its next turn. An authoritative spell gains the lawful descriptor, and the additional effect is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. An authoritative spell uses a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell’s normal spell level. Spells with the chaotic descriptor can’t be authoritative spells.
Axiomatic Discourse				TYPE:Conduit			MULT:NO		DESC:You take inspiration from the greatest debaters and speakers of Axis and weave words with precision, limiting misunderstandings and sharpening comprehension.																																																																																	PRESKILL:2,Diplomacy=3,Knowledge (Planes)=3								SOURCEPAGE:25		BENEFIT:You can activate this feat’s benefits as part of a Diplomacy check to influence a creature’s attitude [before determining the outcome]. If you fail the Diplomacy check, the target’s attitude towards you does not decrease unless you fail the check by 10 or more. Also, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to influence creatures that do not understand your language, but you take a –4 penalty on the check. Once per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge [planes], you can attempt a Diplomacy check twice and take the better result.
Azata Mischeif					TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:You move with uncommon grace that disorients enemies, causing foes that strike at you to overreach and stumble.																	PREABILITY:4,CATEGORY=FEAT,Agile Maneuvers,Azata Style,Dodge,Mobility												PREATT:6																																																															SOURCEPAGE:25		BENEFIT:While using Azata Style, whenever an opponent misses you with an attack of opportunity provoked by your movement through its threatened squares, you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that creature at the end of your turn as a swift action, provided you are still adjacent to the creature when you end your movement for the round. This trip attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You gain a bonus on your combat maneuver check equal to any bonuses to AC you gain against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement [such as that granted by the Mobility feat].
Azata Sprint					TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:You move across the battlefield in a blur.																													PREABILITY:6,CATEGORY=FEAT,Agile Maneuvers,Azata Mischief, Azata Style, Dodge, Mobility, Windstance					PREATT:10																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:26		BENEFIT:While using Azata Style, your base speed increases by 10 feet and you ignore the movement penalties applied by the first 10 feet of difficult terrain you move through in the round.
Azata Style						TYPE:Combat.Style			MULT:NO		DESC:Your quickness and grace keep you alive																													PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility																			PREATT:2																																																													SOURCEPAGE:26		BENEFIT:While using this style, during any round in which you move at least 15 feet, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC. This bonus lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
Blazing Aura					TYPE:Combat.Conduit		MULT:NO		DESC:You cover yourself in coils of flame drawn from the Plane of Fire																																																																																																	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=3										SOURCEPAGE:26		BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can shroud yourself in fire. Until the end of your turn, whenever a creature makes a successful melee attack against you, that creature takes a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 plus half your ranks in Knowledge [planes]; attacks made using reach weapons ignore this effect. A creature can halve this fire damage with a successful Reflex save [DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier]. You can use this feat’s benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge [planes]. If you have at least 9 ranks in Knowledge [planes], activating this ability is a move action. If you have at least 15 ranks in Knowledge [planes], you can activate this ability as a move action or a swift action.
Blissful Spell					TYPE:Metamagic			MULT:NO		DESC:The absolute peace of Nirvana infuses your spells, giving pause to foes and granting boldness to allies																																																																																					ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																		SOURCEPAGE:26		BENEFIT:You can alter any spell that targets a single creature to become a blissful spell, although the exact effects of the metamagic vary depending on whether the spell is beneficial or offensive. A creature successfully hit by an offensive blissful spell [if the spell requires an attack roll] or that fails its saving throw against an offensive blissful spell takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls for 1 round. A beneficial blissful spell instead grants affected creatures a +2 morale bonus on skill checks and saving throws for 1 round in addition to its normal effects. A blissful spell gains the good descriptor, and the additional effect is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A blissful spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell’s normal spell level. Spells with the evil descriptor can’t be blissful spells.
Channel Deific Essence				TYPE:General			MULT:NO		DESC:Rather than bringing forth positive or negative energy to heal allies or blast undead, you channel a fraction of your deity’s power into yourself						PREALIGN:Deity	PREDOMAIN:1,ANY																										PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:ClericChannelPositiveEnergyDice,5],[PREVARGTEQ:ClericChannelNegativeEnergyDice,5],[PREVARGTEQ:OracleChannelDice,5]																																							SOURCEPAGE:26		BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can expend a use of channel energy to select a domain you have. You gain the ability associated with that domain from the invoke deity spell [see page 41] for a number of rounds equal to your number of channel energy dice. While this ability is active, taking actions directly opposed to your deity’s teachings or alignment causes you to take the penalties listed in invoke deity and ends this effect. You can gain only one ability from this feat at a time, and its effects do not stack with invoke deity. If you instead expend two uses of channel energy, you can instead infuse a single willing target within 30 feet with deific essence. The target need not be a worshiper of your deity, but is subject to the same penalties if it takes actions directly opposed to your deity’s teachings or alignment.
Chaos Reigns					TYPE:Conduit			MULT:NO		DESC:The Abyss dreams of devastation; the slightest taste of its power is an incitement to bare-fisted violence.																																																																																										PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=3										SOURCEPAGE:26		BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can allow Abyssal wrath to overtake you. While in this state, you can use one of your hands as a slam natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (or 1d4 for Small creatures). A creature that does not have hands can instead use a different part of its body to make this slam attack. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.
Crypt Spell						TYPE:Metamagic			MULT:NO		DESC:You can infuse your magic with the unswayable power of the Boneyard, sending foes to face ineluctable judgment.																																																																																				ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																		SOURCEPAGE:26		BENEFIT:You can enhance any spell that inflicts hit point damage to become a crypt spell. A creature that dies within 1 round of being damaged by a crypt spell is considered to have been killed by a death effect for the purpose of being returned to life. An undead creature damaged by a crypt spell gains the sickened condition for a number of rounds equal to the spell’s original spell level; this duration is halved if the undead creature succeeds at its saving throw against the spell. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can attempt a Will save to negate the sickened effect. A crypt spell gains the death descriptor. A crypt spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell’s normal spell level.
Death Field						TYPE:Conduit			MULT:NO		DESC:The deadly power of the Negative Energy Plane creates a field that snuffs out life forces at the cost of your own vitality.																																																																																							PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=5										SOURCEPAGE:27		BENEFIT:As a move action, you can exude deadly energyfrom your body. While this death field is in effect, small plants wither and recoil from you, allowing you to ignore the effects of difficult terrain caused by plant life and ignore the effects of spells like entangle that compel vegetation to grasp at you, provided the spell’s level is 3rd or lower [the death field cannot affect more powerful plant magic]. Any swarm that enters your space takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage; this damage is applied before you are affected by any swarm attacks, so if the damage is enough to destroy the swarm, it does not harm you. At the end of your turn each round the death field is active, you take 1 point of negative energy damage, and you cannot be healed by positive energy effects while the death field is in place. Magic items and spells that protect against negative energy damage do not protect against this damage, but if you are undead or have negative energy affinity [or a similar ability], the death field instead grants fast healing 1 while it is in effect. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge [planes]. These rounds need not be consecutive. If you have at least 11 ranks in Knowledge [planes], you can activate your death field as a swift action.
Demonic Momentum					TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:You slam into foes with devastating force, leaving them vulnerable to your vicious strikes.																				PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Demonic Style,Improved Bull Rush,Power Attack											PREATT:5																																																															SOURCEPAGE:27		BENEFIT:While using Demonic Style, when you successfully bull rush an opponent as part of a charge, you gain a +2 bonus on melee weapon damage rolls against that opponent for every 5 feet it was moved by your bull rush. This bonus lasts until the end of your next turn, and it stacks with the damage bonus granted by Demonic Style.
Demonic Slaughter					TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:You punch into your foes’ ranks and cut them down.																											PREABILITY:6,CATEGORY=FEAT,Cleave,Demonic Momentum,Demonic Style,Great Cleave,Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack		PREATT:9																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:27		BENEFIT:While using Demonic Style, when you successfully bull rush an opponent as part of a charge, you can immediately use Great Cleave as though you had used a standard action to do so. This occurs after the effect of your bull rush is fully resolved. The target of your bull rush must be the target of the first attack you make as part of Great Cleave.
Demonic Style					TYPE:Combat.Style			MULT:NO		DESC:Self-preservation is irrelevant in the face of your fury.																										PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack																				PREATT:1																																																												SOURCEPAGE:27		BENEFIT:While using this style, when you use the charge action, the bonus on your attack roll increases by 1 and you deal 2 additional points of damage with melee attacks made as part of the charge. Special: If you have the rage or bloodrage class feature, you can enter Demonic Style’s stance as part of the free action to enter a rage. If you do, the style stance ends when your rage ends.
Diabolic Humiliation				TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:Your humiliating strikes decrease a foe’s morale.																											PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes,Diabolic Style,Vital Strike																PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,Improved Unarmed Strike,Weapon Focus (Unarmed Strike)],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:8],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=7]]																																								SOURCEPAGE:27		BENEFIT:When you successfully stagger a foe with an unarmed strike using Diabolic Style, the target becomes further humiliated. The target cannot gain the benefit of any morale bonus for 1 minute after being staggered in this way, and for the duration of that minute, any additional staggered effects it suffers from your attacks of opportunity last for 2 rounds rather than 1. The durations of multiple staggered effects administered in this way stack. Special: A monk of at least 10th level with this feat can select Improved Vital Strike as a monk bonus feat.
Diabolic Judgement				TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:You punish your foes for every opportunity they present.																										PREABILITY:5,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes,Diabolic Humiliation,Diabolic Style,Improved Vital Strike,Vital Strike					PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,Improved Unarmed Strike,Weapon Focus (Unarmed Strike)],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:12],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=11]]																																												SOURCEPAGE:27		BENEFIT:While using Diabolic Style, the first time each round that you successfully hit with an attack of opportunity, you can apply the effects of any Vital Strike feat you have to that attack. Special: A monk of at least 14th level with this feat can select Greater Vital Strike as a monk bonus feat.
Diabolic Style					TYPE:Combat.Style			MULT:NO		DESC:You utilize combat as an opportunity to inflict humiliation upon those who provoke your attacks of opportunity.																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes																							PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,Improved Unarmed Strike,Weapon Focus (Unarmed Strike)],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:2],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=1]]																																					SOURCEPAGE:27		BENEFIT:While using this style, you can make an attack of opportunity with an unarmed strike to deliver a humiliating swat to the target. If you hit the target, you inflict 1 point of nonlethal damage and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw [DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier] or become staggered for 1 round. Special: A monk of at least 6th level with this feat can select Vital Strike as a monk bonus feat.
Flickering Step					TYPE:Conduit			MULT:NO		DESC:You can appear and disappear in the blink of an eye. 																																																																																																			PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=9										SOURCEPAGE:28		BENEFIT:You can use dimension door as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your ranks in Knowledge [planes]. You can’t teleport a distance greater than twice your base speed in this way, and you must have both line of sight and line of effect to your destination. You can use this feat’s benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge [planes]. A fighter with this feat treats Dimensional Agility and any feat that lists it as a prerequisite as though they were combat feats when selecting fighter bonus feats.
Gloomstorm						TYPE:Combat.Conduit		MULT:NO		DESC:An inexhaustible arsenal lies in the Shadow Plane, waiting to be unleashed.																																																																																															PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=4										SOURCEPAGE:28		BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can thin the barriers between yourself and the Shadow Plane, allowing you to create shadow weapons more easily. While this effect is active, you can create new shadow weapons as a free action. This does not increase the number of shadow weapons you can maintain at a single time. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.
#Gloomstorm needs the Shadow Weapon class feature added once it's built as an achetype
CATEGORY:Feat|Grasping Tail.MOD		TYPE:General			MULT:NO		DESC:Your tail becomes more useful, and can be used to grab or hold small items.															PRETEXT:You must have a tail.																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:28		BENEFIT:You can use your tail to grab stowed items. While you cannot wield weapons with your tail, you can use it to retrieve small, stowed objects carried on your person as a swift action. BENEFIT:If you have the prehensile tail tiefling racial trait, you can use your tail to grab unattended items within 5 feet or stowed objects carried on your person as a swift action; you can hold such objects with your tail, though you cannot manipulate them with it (other than to put them in your hand).|PRERACE:1,Tiefling
Gravitational Vital Strike			TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:You use unusual gravities to adjust your vital strikes.																																																	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Vital Strike,Heavy Gravity Acclimation],[PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Vital Strike,Light Gravity Acclimation]																																								SOURCEPAGE:28		BENEFIT:When using any Vital Strike feat in an area of light or heavy gravity, roll the weapon’s damage dice for the attack one additional time. For example, if using Improved Vital Strike, you would roll the weapon’s damage dice for the attack four times before adding other damage bonuses, instead of three times. You must have the appropriate prerequisite feat associated with the plane’s gravity trait to gain this benefit.
Greater Planer Infusion				TYPE:Conduit			MULT:NO		DESC:You have mastered the powers of another plane.																												PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Planar Infusion,Planar Infusion		PRELEVEL:MIN=13																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:28		BENEFIT:Choose a plane for which you’ve gained an improved infusion via Improved Planar Infusion. You gain that plane’s greater infusion as well.
#Greater Planar Infusion will need to be changed to MULT:YES and given a CHOOSE tag for planes slected from the base and improved Planar Infusion feats
Greater Subjective Slam				TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:Your gravitational impact is meteoric, and your ability to use the act of falling devastating.															PRESTAT:2,CON=15,WIS=15		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Subjective Slam,Subjective Mobility													PREMULT:1,[PREATT:8],[PRECLASS:1,MONK=7]																																																										SOURCEPAGE:28		BENEFIT:When using Subjective Slam, you take only a –1 penalty on the combat maneuver check for every 100 feet of falling speed, and the maximum damage for such a slam increases to 12d6.
Healer's Hands					TYPE:Conduit			MULT:NO		DESC:Your healing efforts are bolstered by positive energy.																																																																																																			PRESKILL:2,Heal=1,Knowledge (Planes)=1									SOURCEPAGE:28		BENEFIT:You can use the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds as a full-round action. You do not take a penalty for not using a healer’s kit when treating deadly wounds this way, and you can do so on a given creature more than once per day. When treating deadly wounds this way, if your result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, add your ranks in Knowledge (planes) to the damage healed. These benefits do not apply to creatures that are not healed by positive energy. You can use this feat’s benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes).
Heaven's Light					TYPE:Conduit			MULT:NO		DESC:You are a luminous beacon in the darkness, an icon of order and kindness through which the light of Heaven itself can shine, even in the most dreadful of realms.																																																																																	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=1										SOURCEPAGE:28		BENEFIT: As a standard action, you can emit an aura of bright light centered on a glowing halo above or behind your head. The illumination provided is equal in intensity to that of a torch. If you have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes) the illumination is equivalent to that created by a daylight spell. If you have at least 15 ranks in Knowledge (planes), the light becomes further infused with Heavenly power, and each evil creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or become sickened by the light for as long as it remains in range plus 1 additional round after leaving the area. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.
Heavy Gravity Acclimation			TYPE:General			MULT:NO		DESC:Your muscles work overtime in areas with heavy gravity.																																																	PREMULT:1,[PRESTAT:1,STR=17],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Endurance]																																																					SOURCEPAGE:29		BENEFIT:You do not take the normal penalties for being on heavy gravity planes. At the GM’s discretion, this effect may apply to certain environments on the Material Plane, such as high-gravity planets. In addition, your Strength is considered to be 4 higher for the purpose of determining your carrying capacity.
Hollow Soul						TYPE:Conduit			MULT:NO		DESC:You can temporarily replace your soul with a fragment of the all-consuming void of Abaddon.																																																																																												PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=9										SOURCEPAGE:29		BENEFIT:As a move action, you can enter a state of emotional and spiritual hollowness. While in this state, you react to positive and negative energy as if you were undead— positive energy harms you, while negative energy heals you. Whenever you are targeted by an effect that specifically affects living creatures or undead creatures, or that affects both in different ways, you have a 50% chance to count as an undead creature rather than a living creature. You are immune to effects that specifically target your soul (such as trap the soul). However, while under the effect of this feat, you cannot benefit from beneficial mind-affecting effects, morale bonuses, or bardic performances. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.
Improved Planar Infusion			TYPE:Conduit			MULT:NO		DESC:Your connection to the planes has grown stronger.																											PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Planar Infusion						PRELEVEL:MIN=7																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:29		BENEFIT:Choose a plane you’ve gained an infusion from via Planar Infusion. You now gain that plane’s improved infusion as well.
#Needs to change to MULT:YES and get a CHOOSE tag once Planar Infusion feat is built
Improved Plane Shift				TYPE:General			MULT:NO		DESC:You’re an expert at traveling the various realms of the Great Beyond via plane shift.																																																																									PRECLASS:1,Wizard=9																																SOURCEPAGE:30		BENEFIT:Add plane shift to your spell list and to your spellbook as a 5th-level wizard spell. The time required for you to identify a portal’s destination is reduced to 1 round. In addition, you automatically identify any plane on which you arrive. A wizard can select this as a wizard bonus feat.
#Figure out how to reduce the spell level of Plane Shift, figure out how to make this elibible as a wizard bonus feat
Lashing Tail					TYPE:Combat				MULT:NO		DESC:Your tail is either thick and heavy enough to serve as a weapon, or else is adorned with barbs or quills that weaponize its lashing length.				PRETEXT:You must have a tail				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Grasping Tail																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:30		BENEFIT:You gain a tail slap natural attack that deals damage as appropriate for your size (1d6 points for a Medium creature, or 1d4 points for a small creature). When you first gain this feat, choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing; this is the type of damage your tail inflicts, and it cannot be later changed. Due to the inherent awkwardness of attacking with your tail, you can’t make a tail slap attack and other natural weapon attacks as part of the same full attack. Treat your tail slap attack as a secondary attack if you also attack with a manufactured weapon as part of a full-attack action.		NATURALATTACKS:Tail,Weapon.Natural.Melee.Piercing.Slashing.Bludgeoning.*1,1d6
#Lashing Tail's natural weapon not set up correctly. Needs to be adjusted to respect Small vs Medium size, needs some sort of CHOOSE to define Piercing/Slashing/Bludgeoning

#####
#Each feat takes one line and the first field must be the feat's name. In the Example the name of the feat is Skill Focus.
#When naming feats you should only use parentheses at the end of the name if the name is not duplicated elsewhere. This is
#because of how PCGen names feats which can be taken multiple times. For example, the Feat Weapon Focus when taken will display
#as Weapon Focus(Dagger). Another example is Armor Proficiency (Light), there is no feat named Armor Proficiency so this name
#is fine. What is happening is when PCGen finds a feat with parentheses that duplicates the name of another feat it assumes
#that feat is an instance of the one without parentheses and does not display the one with parentheses.
#
#The TYPE tag is holding a . (period) delimited list of the types the feat is.
#
#The DESC tag is used to hold the description of the Feat. In our files we usually keep the description brief, so the user
#still need to own the book to make use of of the data, but for your personal files can get as elaborate as you want there.
#
#The MULT tag determines if a feat can be taken multiple times. If the value is set to YES, then you MUST also use a CHOOSE
#tag.
#
#The CHOOSE tag must be paired with a MULT:YES tag in feats for it to work properly. It will display a popup window that asks
#for a selection according to what is being called for. There is a multitude of existing CHOOSE tags in PCGen. If you are
#looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic "CHOOSE tags".
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the feat. This will be displayed in PCGen.
